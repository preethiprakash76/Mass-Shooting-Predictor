# Mass-Shooting-Predictor

US mass Shooting - Analysis

The complete dataset is about 320 observations out of which the data is divided into two parts
which is training and testing. I have divided my training into 83% of the data and 17% of the
data is taken for testing and prediction. The seed value I have for the training set is 76598.

As the response variable is binary, I used logistic regression model to fit and train the model.
Firstly I have ran the entire model using logistic regression and then used forward and backward
model techniques to fit the model accordingly.
